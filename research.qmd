I believe data science should empower people with tools to guide the directions of research and technology consciously and inclusively. I'm motivated by applications in **algorithmic fairness** and discrimination, **responsible AI**, and model **interpretability and explainability**. My research is primarily theoretical and develops modeling frameworks based on causality, a theory of changing the world. I hope these frameworks enable clear thinking about challenging problems and promote effective communication among interdisciplinary researchers and stakeholders alike.

## Causal models in machine learning

Conceptual simplicity is important in human-centered data science. Using simple causal models as hypotheses allows people to ask the questions they really care about, make their assumptions transparent, and communicate clearly to broad audiences. I argue my case for a causal revolution in data science in this recent [position paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/loftus24a.html) (ICML 2024).

Much of my work in this area focuses on fair machine learning and algorithmic discrimination. With the paper [Counterfactual Fairness](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/a486cd07e4ac3d270571622f4f316ec5-Abstract.html) (NeurIPS 2017) my co-authors and I helped start a growing, interdisciplinary research field of causal fairness. See this [Nature Comment](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00274-3) for a high level overview.

Recently I started working on causal frameworks for model interpretation and explanation. Beginning with feature dependence visualization, our paper [Causal Dependence Plots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04209) (NeurIPS 2024) makes use of information about causal dependence between features when plotting predicted outputs. The figure below compares CDPs (a) with several other methods for visualizing feature dependence on a simulated data example. Notice that the blue curve in panel (a), our Total Dependence Plot, indicates a stronger increasing relationship which all the other methods fail to capture.

## Post-selection inference

This work involves challenging mathematical and computational aspects of conducting inference after model selection procedures with complicated underlying geometry. This enables significance testing, for example, after using some of the most popular model selection procedures such as the lasso with regularization chosen by cross-validation, or forward stepwise with number of steps chosen by AIC or BIC. Often the resulting significance tests are slightly modified versions of the classical tests in regression analysis. This [blog post](https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-12-22-a-conditional-approach-to-inference-after-model-selection/a-conditional-approach-to-inference-after-model-selection.html) introduces the basic idea.
