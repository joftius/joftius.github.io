title: "Inference after model selection"
description: |
  This work involves challenging mathematical and computational aspects of conducting inference after model selection procedures with complicated underlying geometry. This enables significance testing, for example, after using some of the most popular model selection procedures such as the lasso with regularization chosen by cross-validation, or forward stepwise with number of steps chosen by AIC or BIC. Often the resulting significance tests are slightly modified versions of the classical tests in regression analysis.

# Post-selection inference

This work involves challenging mathematical and computational aspects of conducting inference after model selection procedures with complicated underlying geometry. This enables significance testing, for example, after using some of the most popular model selection procedures such as the lasso with regularization chosen by cross-validation, or forward stepwise with number of steps chosen by AIC or BIC. Often the resulting significance tests are slightly modified versions of the classical tests in regression analysis.
