> [Later `r emo::ji("airplane")`,] Microsoft’s Bing, [...] repeated the false claim about Turley — citing among its sources an op-ed by Turley [...] outlining his experience of being falsely accused by ChatGPT.

> Amazon’s system **taught itself** that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word "women's," as in "women's chess club captain." And it downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges, according to people familiar with the matter.

### At some point we must decide

#### Which (causal) model reveals our beliefs?

[George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box):


> [All models are wrong](All_models_are_wrong) but some are useful

--

therefore,

> ... the scientist must be alert to what is **importantly wrong**

> ... **cannot obtain a "correct" one** by excessive elaboration

---

### At some point we must decide

#### Which version of fairness to achieve?

**(Simplified) impossibility theorem** see, e.g.: Kleinberg et al (2016), Chouldechova (2016) 

> Unless the world is already fair, the only algorithms satisfying both equal treatment (or opportunity) and equal outcomes (demographic parity) are trivial ones (e.g. jail everyone)

(More about these fairness definitions coming up next)

# Statistical discrimination

---

### Notation: fairness in supervised learning

- Outcome variable $Y$, consider as a score for decisions, or $Y = 1$ as the desirable decision
- Sensitive/protected attribute(s) $A$, e.g. race, gender, ...
- Other predictors $X$, not sensitive (*prima facie*)

--

Machine learning task: learn a function $f(X,A)$ from (labeled) training data to predict values of $\hat Y = f(X,A)$ on (unlabeled/future) test data (by minimizing some loss function that measures closeness of $\hat Y$ to $Y$ on the training data)

--

What would it mean for such function to be fair with respect to $A$?

---

## Statistical / demographic parity

Perhaps the most straightforward definition (and my favorite), often described as **equality of outcomes**

#### Demographic parity 
Predictions (or decisions) are independent of $A$:
$$
P(\hat Y | A = 0) = P(\hat Y | A = 1)
$$

---

## Equality of opportunity

#### Equality of opportunity (Hardt et al, 2016)
The accuracy of the algorithm does not depend on $A$:
$$
P(\hat Y = 1 | A = 0, Y = 1) = P(\hat Y = 1 | A = 1, Y = 1)
$$
Demographic parity but only among individuals 'qualified' for the desirable outcome

---

## Fairness through unawareness

"Equal treatment," people tend to believe such treatment is fair.

#### Grgic-Hlaca et al. (2016)
Prediction does not explicitly use $A$, i.e.
$$
\hat Y = f(X)
$$

---

## Individual fairness

#### Dwork et al. (2012)
Similar predictions for individuals who are similar (in their unprotected attributes). If $X_i \approx X_{i'}$ then

$$\hat Y(X_i, A_i) \approx \hat Y(X_{i'}, A_{i'})$$

Continuity-like condition but not in $A$. Intuitively related to privacy and also matching approaches to causal inference.
