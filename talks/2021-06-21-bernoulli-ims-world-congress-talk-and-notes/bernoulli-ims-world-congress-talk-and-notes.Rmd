## Bernoulli-IMS World Congress 2020

This conference was originally scheduled for last year but postponed due to the COVID pandemic. Slides are linked below for my talk in the session on recent advances in statistics, and I will update this post with notes and comments about the rest of the conference or in response to questions during the live session.
