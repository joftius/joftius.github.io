This enables significance testing, for example, after using some of the most popular model selection procedures such as the lasso with regularization chosen by cross-validation, or forward stepwise with number of steps chosen by AIC or BIC. Often the resulting significance tests are slightly modified versions of the classical tests in regression analysis.\nimage: https://joshualoftus.com/posts/2020-12-22-a-conditional-approach-to-inference-after-model-selection/a-conditional-approach-to-inference-after-model-selection_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png\nauthor:\n  - name: Joshua Loftus\ndate: 2022-02-17\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Post-selection inference\n\nThis work involves challenging mathematical and computational aspects of conducting inference after model selection procedures with complicated underlying geometry.
